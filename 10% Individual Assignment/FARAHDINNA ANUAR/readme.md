Editor: IDE for python

###EMACS 

Emacs is a text editor that is highly extensible and customizable. 
It is written in the Emacs Lisp programming language, 
which allows users to write their own extensions and commands to tailor Emacs to their specific needs.
Emacs is more than just a text editor. It can also be used as a programming environment, 
a project management tool, a note-taking app, and more. There are thousands of Emacs packages available,
which add new features and functionality to the editor.Emacs is a powerful tool that can be used for a wide variety of tasks.
It is popular among programmers, scientists, and other professionals who need a powerful and flexible text editor.
 
EMACS Significance
1. Emacs is fast
Emacs, in every way, is faster than anything else. When we learns to navigate by muscle memory, it may move almost by itself. 
Emacs and other command line editors only accept keyboard input for file navigation, macro execution,
and any other function you would expect your development environment to provide.

2. Emacs highly customizable
Emacs is really an operating system, it can set it up to accommodate any kind of workflow that can think of. 
Simpler functions like producing LaTeX automatically, integrating debuggers directly into the editor, 
and accessing documentation are either pre-integrated into Emacs or can be obtained as a third-party package.
The fundamental features of Emacs are simple to learn.

3. Emacs is easy to learn 
Among the best tutorials for learning any text editor is the Emacs tutorial. 
It covers all of the key components of Emacs and is clearly laid out and easy to follow.


Framework:

###DOOM EMACS 

Doom Emacs is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, 
and also provides a wide range of features and functionality out of the box.
Doom Emacs is built on top of the Spacemacs configuration framework, but it makes a number of changes and improvements.
 For example, Doom Emacs uses a different keybinding scheme, 
it provides a more comprehensive set of packages, and it is easier to customize.
Doom Emacs is a great option for users who want a powerful and extensible Emacs configuration with minimal effort.
It is also a good choice for users who are new to Emacs, as it provides a good starting point for learning the editor.

DOOM EMACS Significance
1. Doom Emacs is easy to use 
Doom Emacs is made to be simple to use and modify. 
It can use it straight away because it comes with a pre-configured set of packages and keybindings.

2.Powerful extensible 
One of the most flexible and durable Emacs settings out there, Spacemacs is the foundation upon which Doom Emacs is based.

3.Easy to customize 
Customizing Doom Emacs is simple. To fit what we needs, we can add or delete packages, 
and also alter the configuration, and adjust the keybindings.


Library:
###OpenCV

OpenCV for Python is a Python binding for the OpenCV library. It allows Python developers to use the OpenCV library to develop computer vision and machine learning applications. OpenCV for Python is easy to use and provides a comprehensive set of functions for image processing, object detection, and machine learning.

To use OpenCV for Python, you need to install the OpenCV-Python package. This package can be installed using Pip or Conda. Once the OpenCV-Python package is installed, you can import the OpenCV library into your Python code and start using its functions.


MAGIT Significance


1. Image processing
OpenCV provides a wide range of image processing functions, such as filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction.

2. Computer vision
OpenCV can be used to develop computer vision applications, such as object detection, tracking, and recognition.

3.Machine learning
OpenCV can be used to develop machine learning models for image classification, regression, and segmentation.
