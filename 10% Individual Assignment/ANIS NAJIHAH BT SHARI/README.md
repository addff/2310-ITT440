*** Library/Module in Python created for Network Engineer ***
### TEXTFSM

A Python package called TextFSM is used to parse semi-structured text into tables in 
Python. Although it is a template-based state machine, it excels at parsing any kind 
of text, but it is especially useful for parsing output from CLI-driven hardware, 
including network switches and routers.

A template file and a text input are used as inputs by TextFSM. The text input is the 
data that has to be parsed, and the template file specifies its structure. Following 
that, TextFSM extracts the data from the text input using the template and returns it 
as a list of Python dictionaries.

### NORNIR

Nornir is a Python framework used for network automation. In addition to 
providing concurrency and inventory management, it also enables activities execution 
against data collections, including device inventories. Nornir can be used with many 
other Python libraries, like Scrapli, NAPALM, and Netmiko, because it is pluggable.

Given its multi-threaded architecture, Nornir is capable of handling several devices 
at once when executing tasks. When a lot of devices are being automated, this can 
greatly improve the automation process.

The Nornir structure is also incredibly adaptable. Numerous jobs, from straightforward 
ones like gathering device data to more intricate ones like installing new configurations
or debugging network issues, can be automated with it.


*** Editor/IDE in Python ***
### VIM

Vim is an advanced text editor that aims to offer an additional feature set 
together with the capabilities of the de-facto Unix editor "Vi". Also a well-known 
text editor for its effectiveness and capability. It is helpful whether you are 
using Vi or another editor. evim, often known as Easy Vim, is a configuration for 
Vim that makes it work very simply, much like Notepad.

Developers, system administrators, and other users who require precise and 
fast text editing are fond of it. Vim is ideal for text editing of any kind, 
including altering configuration files and writing emails.

Vim is not an editor meant to guide its users. It's a tool that requires some 
learning to apply. VIM is not a word processor. It does not offer 'what you see
is what you get' (WYSIWYG) editing of typeset documents, despite the fact that 
it can display text with different formatting and highlighting styles.
