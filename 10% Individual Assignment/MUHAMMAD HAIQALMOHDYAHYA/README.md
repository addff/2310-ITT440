	-TOOLS ( EDITOR, LIBRARY, FRAMEWORK )-

EDITOR : IDLE

IDle, or Integrated Development and Learning Environment, is a straightforward and lightweight Python IDE that comes bundled with the standard Python distribution. 
Designed with simplicity in mind, IDLE caters to beginners and learners, providing an interactive Python shell for quick experimentation with code and a script 
editor with features like syntax highlighting and basic debugging tools. While it may lack some of the advanced features found in more robust IDEs, IDLE serves 
as an accessible starting point for those new to Python, offering a user-friendly environment for writing and running Python scripts. Its inclusion with the 
standard Python package ensures that users can begin coding without the need for additional installations, making it a convenient choice for introductory 
programming and learning exercises.

LIBRARY : PSUTIL

psutil is a powerful and cross-platform Python library that facilitates easy access to system-related information and process management. Short for 
"process and system utilities," it provides a consistent and straightforward interface for retrieving details on CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, 
network activity, and more. Network engineers, system administrators, and developers can leverage psutil to monitor and optimize system performance, 
analyze resource utilization, and gain insights into running processes. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool for tasks such as process manipulation, 
real-time system monitoring, and crafting applications that require comprehensive information about a computer's state. With its ease of use and platform 
compatibility, psutil stands out as a go-to library for system-related operations in Python.

FRAMEWORK : BEHAVE

Behave is a Python testing framework that follows the principles of behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing developers to write tests in a natural language 
format for enhanced collaboration between technical and non-technical team members. It leverages the Gherkin language with keywords like "Given," "When," and 
"Then" to describe system behavior in a human-readable manner. Tests are organized in feature files using Gherkin syntax, and the associated step definitions 
are implemented in Python. Behave facilitates clear communication of requirements, making it easier to understand and maintain test scenarios. By combining the 
benefits of BDD with the simplicity of Python, Behave offers a powerful and user-friendly approach to writing and executing behavior-driven tests.

	-HOW TO USE THE TOOLS-
	
> IDLE

Using IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) for Python is quite straightforward. Here's a basic guide to get you started:-

1. **Opening IDLE:**
   - On Windows: You can find IDLE in the Start menu. Look for "IDLE (Python x.x)" where "x.x" is your Python version.
   - On macOS/Linux: Open a terminal and type `idle` or `idle3` (depending on your Python version) and press Enter.

2. **Interactive Shell:**
   - Once IDLE is open, you'll see the Python shell window. This is an interactive environment where you can enter Python commands and see immediate results.

3. **Creating a New Script:**
   - Click on "File" in the menu and choose "New File" to open a new script window.

4. **Writing Python Code:**
   - In the script window, you can write your Python code. For example:

   ```
    print("Hello, IDLE!")
   ```
    
6. **Running the Script:**
   - Save your script with a `.py` extension. Click on "Run" in the menu and choose "Run Module" or press `F5`. Alternatively, you can right-click in the 
	script window and choose "Run Module."

7. **Interactive Debugging (Optional):**
   - IDLE has a basic integrated debugger. You can set breakpoints and run your script in debugging mode. To do this, click on "Debug" in the menu and 
	choose "Debugger" or press `Ctrl + F5`.

8. **Closing IDLE:**
   - When you're done, you can close IDLE by clicking on the "X" button in the upper right corner of the Python shell or script window.

Remember, IDLE is a basic and lightweight IDE, suitable for learning and small projects. For more complex development, you might consider using other IDEs like 
PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or others based on your preferences and project requirements.

> PSUTIL

To use the psutil library in IDLE (Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment), you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Psutil:**
   Make sure `psutil` is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. **Import Psutil in IDLE:**
   Open IDLE and create a new script. Import the `psutil` module in your script:

   ```python
   import psutil
   ```

3. **Use Psutil Functions:**
   Now, you can use various functions provided by `psutil` to gather system information. For example:

   ```python
   # Get CPU usage
   cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent()
   print(f'CPU Usage: {cpu_usage}%')

   # Get memory usage
   memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
   print(f'Total Memory: {memory_info.total} bytes')
   print(f'Used Memory: {memory_info.used} bytes')

   # Get disk usage
   disk_info = psutil.disk_usage('/')
   print(f'Total Disk Space: {disk_info.total} bytes')
   print(f'Used Disk Space: {disk_info.used} bytes')
   ```

   Adjust the functions and parameters according to your specific needs.

4. **Run the Script:**
   Save your script and run it in IDLE. You should see the output displaying information about CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.

> BEHAVE

Behave is a popular BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework for Python. To use Behave in IDLE (Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment), you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Behave:**
   Make sure Behave is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install behave
   ```

2. **Create a Feature File:**
   Create a feature file with Gherkin syntax. Save it with a `.feature` extension. For example, `my_feature.feature`:

   ```gherkin
   Feature: Behave in IDLE
       Scenario: Running Behave in IDLE
           Given I have Behave installed
           When I run Behave in IDLE
           Then it should execute the feature file
   ```

3. **Create Step Definitions:**
   Create step definition files that match the steps in your feature file. Save it as `my_steps.py`:

   ```python
   from behave import given, when, then

   @given('I have Behave installed')
   def step_impl(context):
       pass

   @when('I run Behave in IDLE')
   def step_impl(context):
       pass

   @then('it should execute the feature file')
   def step_impl(context):
       pass
   ```

4. **Run Behave in IDLE:**
   Open IDLE and navigate to the directory containing your feature file and step definitions. Use IDLE's shell to run Behave:

   ```python
   from behave import __main__ as behave_main

   behave_main.main(['my_feature.feature'])
   ```

   Make sure to replace `'my_feature.feature'` with the actual name of your feature file.

5. **View Results:**
   Behave will execute your feature file, and you'll see the results in the IDLE shell.
