1. WHAT IS PYQT
   
PyQt is a significant GUI framework because it is mature, comprehensive, efficient, and 
portable.  It has been used to create  a  wide range of applications, including desktop 
applications, mobile applications, web applications, and embedded systems applications. 

3. SIGNIFICANCE OF PYQT
   
PyQt is a popular choice for Python GUI development because it is:

- Mature: PyQt has been around for over 20 years and is well-supported.
- Comprehensive:  PyQt provides bindings for all of the Qt classes,  including widgets, 
  signals, and slots.
- Efficient:  PyQt applications are compiled to native code,  so  they  are  as fast as 
  applications written in C++ or other native languages.
- Portable:  PyQt applications can be run on all platforms that Qt supports,  including 
  Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.
  
PyQt has been used to create a wide range of applications, including:

- Desktop applications:  PyQt is often used  to create  desktop  applications,  such as 
  graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for scientific and engineering software.
- Mobile applications:  PyQt can also be used to create mobile applications for Android 
  and iOS devices.
- Web applications:  PyQt can be used to create web applications using the Qt WebEngine 
  module.
- Embedded systems:  PyQt can also be used to create embedded systems applications.
