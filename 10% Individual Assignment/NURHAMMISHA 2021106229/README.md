**What is Pelican?**

Pelican is a static site generator written in Python. It allows you to create web pages and blogs from reStructuredText, Markdown, or other formats. Static site generators like Pelican take your content (written in a markup language), process it, and generate a set of static HTML files that can be served by a web server.

**Pelican's features :**

1. **Plugin System**: Pelican features a plugin system that enables users to extend its functionality. There are several plugins available for tasks like SEO optimization, image optimization, and more.
   
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Pelican includes support for syntax highlighting of code snippets in your articles or pages, improving readability for technical content.
   
3. **Simple Configuration**: Pelican uses a configuration file (usually named pelicanconf.py) to store settings for your site. This file allows you to control various aspects of your site's behavior, such as the theme, URLs, and metadata.
   
4. **Markdown and reStructuredText Support**: Pelican supports content written in both Markdown and reStructuredText, providing flexibility in choosing a markup language.
