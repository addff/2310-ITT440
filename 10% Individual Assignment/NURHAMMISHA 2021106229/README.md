## FRAMEWORK : CAFFE
**What is Caffe?**

Caffe, which stands for Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding, is a deep learning framework that was developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) at the University of California, Berkeley. It is primarily designed for training and deploying deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

**Caffe's features :**

1. **Modularity**: Caffe is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to define and experiment with custom network architectures. Models are constructed by specifying layers and their configurations in a prototxt file, making it highly flexible and adaptable to various neural network designs.
   
2. **Extensive Layer Library**: Caffe provides a wide range of layer types commonly used in deep learning models, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and more. This rich set of layers allows users to build diverse network architectures.
   
3.  **Memory Efficiency**: Caffe is designed to be memory-efficient, which is crucial for working with large datasets and complex models. It optimizes memory usage during training and inference.
   
4.  **Speed and Efficiency**: Caffe is known for its fast performance. It is implemented in C++ and optimized for speed, and it can take advantage of GPU acceleration through NVIDIA CUDA. This speed is especially useful for real-time and high-performance applications.

## LIBRARY : BOKEH
**What is Bokeh?**

Bokeh is an open-source Python library for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations in web browsers. The name "Bokeh" is derived from the Japanese word "boke," which refers to the aesthetic quality of the blur in the out-of-focus areas of a photograph. The library is designed to help users create interactive, data-driven visualizations with a focus on aesthetics and interactivity.

**Bokeh's features :**

1. **Interactive Widgets**: Bokeh provides interactive widgets like sliders, buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs that can be used to control and filter data in real time. These widgets make it easy to build interactive dashboards.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Bokeh visualizations work on different platforms and are compatible with major web browsers, making them accessible to a broad audience.

3. **Interactive Web-Based Visualizations**: Bokeh is designed for creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed in web browsers. It provides a JavaScript-based front-end that allows for rich interactivity in web applications.

4. **Streaming Data**: Bokeh supports streaming data, allowing you to update your visualizations in real time. This is useful for applications that require live data updates and monitoring.
