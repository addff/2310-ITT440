**What is Pelican?**

Pelican is a static site generator written in Python. It allows you to create web pages and blogs from reStructuredText, Markdown, or other formats. Static site generators like Pelican take your content (written in a markup language), process it, and generate a set of static HTML files that can be served by a web server.

**Pelican's features :**

1. **Plugin System**: Pelican features a plugin system that enables users to extend its functionality. There are several plugins available for tasks like SEO optimization, image optimization, and more.
   
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Pelican includes support for syntax highlighting of code snippets in your articles or pages, improving readability for technical content.
   
3. **Simple Configuration**: Pelican uses a configuration file (usually named pelicanconf.py) to store settings for your site. This file allows you to control various aspects of your site's behavior, such as the theme, URLs, and metadata.
   
4. **Markdown and reStructuredText Support**: Pelican supports content written in both Markdown and reStructuredText, providing flexibility in choosing a markup language.

**Installation**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Pelican using 'pip':

3. If you are using Python 3, you might need to use 'pip3' instead of 'pip':
   
![pip3](https://github.com/addff/2310-ITT440/assets/149034575/e3957b17-a91f-4d39-b2e2-2c04fc795e88)
4. After the installation is complete, you can verify it by checking the installed version:

**What is Bokeh?**

Bokeh is an open-source Python library for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations in web browsers. The name "Bokeh" is derived from the Japanese word "boke," which refers to the aesthetic quality of the blur in the out-of-focus areas of a photograph. The library is designed to help users create interactive, data-driven visualizations with a focus on aesthetics and interactivity.

**Bokeh's features :**

1. **Interactive Widgets**: Bokeh provides interactive widgets like sliders, buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs that can be used to control and filter data in real time. These widgets make it easy to build interactive dashboards.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Bokeh visualizations work on different platforms and are compatible with major web browsers, making them accessible to a broad audience.

3. **Interactive Web-Based Visualizations**: Bokeh is designed for creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed in web browsers. It provides a JavaScript-based front-end that allows for rich interactivity in web applications.

4. **Streaming Data**: Bokeh supports streaming data, allowing you to update your visualizations in real time. This is useful for applications that require live data updates and monitoring.

## EDITOR : LEO
![leo](https://github.com/addff/2310-ITT440/assets/149034575/082062e9-881b-498a-8efc-cb6ff6dfcac0)

**What is Leo?**

Leo is a unique and versatile text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that focuses on outliners and literate programming. It is designed for developers and writers who want to organize and work with hierarchical structures of content

**Leo's features :**

1. **Literate Programming**: Leo fully supports literate programming, allowing you to intermingle code and documentation within the same document. This approach enhances the comprehensibility of your code and its accompanying explanations.

2. **Cloning Nodes**: Leo supports the concept of cloning nodes. This allows you to reuse sections of code or text in multiple locations within your outline. Changes made to the original node are automatically reflected in all clones.

3. **Dual-Paned Interface**: Leo typically features a dual-paned interface. The left pane displays the outline structure, while the right pane displays the content associated with the selected node. This dual-pane view is central to its organizational structure.

4. **Outliner Structure**: Leo uses an outliner structure where you organize your content hierarchically in the form of an outline. Nodes represent sections or parts of your content, and you can nest them to create a structured document.
