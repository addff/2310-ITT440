## PANDAS
	
	Pandas stands as a potent open-source Python library specifically designed to handle, analyze, and transform data efficiently. 
	This library offers an array of data structures and tools tailored for manipulating, preparing, and analyzing diverse data sets. 
	It includes structures like Series, which mirrors a single row or column of data, akin to network attributes, and the more comprehensive DataFrame, 
	resembling a multi-dimensional table, similar to the tables used in network traffic analysis. Additionally, Pandas provides extensive 
	capabilities for cleaning data, accessing, and selecting data elements, handling missing or duplicate data instances, all of which are crucial 
	skills in the realm of network analysis and optimization. The library's proficiency in data manipulation, coupled with its compatibility for reading and 
	writing various data formats, renders it an indispensable asset for network data visualization and interpretation,aligning seamlessly 
	with the practices and requirements of a network student dealing with structured information flow and analysis.

## Advantages of Pandas.
	
	### 1.Data Structures
	
	Pandas introduces two primary data structures: Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional). 
	These structures are highly efficient and offer flexibility in handling structured data, allowing 
	for easy manipulation and analysis.

	### 2.Data cleaning and Preparation.
	
	It provides various tools to clean and prepare messy data. With functions for handling missing data,
	reshaping data, and converting data types, Pandas streamlines the process of getting data ready for analysis.
	
	### 3.Data Filtering and Selection
	
	Pandas allows for intuitive slicing, indexing, and subsetting of data. This is particularly useful for
	extracting specific portions of data or performing conditional operations.

	### 4.Data Analysis and Exploration
	
	The library offers functionalities for statistical and mathematical operations on data. It enables calculations,
	aggregations, and descriptive statistics, making it easier to gain insights and understand the data.

	### 5.Data Joining and Merging
	
	Pandas facilitates combining datasets by merging or joining, similar to SQL database operations.
	This is helpful when working with multiple datasets or tables.
	
	### 6.Time Series Analysis
	
	It provides powerful tools for working with time series data, including date range generation,
	shifting, lagging, and rolling window calculations, which are commonly used in financial and 
	temporal data analysis.
	
	### 7.Data Visualization 
	
	While Pandas itself is not a visualization library, it integrates well with visualization tools
	like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It allows for quick and straightforward data plotting and visualization.
	
	### 8.Data Input/Output
	
	Pandas supports reading and writing data in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON,
	and more. This versatility makes it easy to work with different data sources and export processed data.

	### Conclusion For PANDAS
	
	Pandas, in general, simplifies many common data-related tasks, making it an invaluable tool for data scientists,
	analysts, and anyone working with Python data. Its simplicity of use, extensive functionalities, and
	versatility in data manipulation make it a go-to library for a wide range of data-related tasks.
	

##  Demonstrate the use of some essential tools in Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

	### 1. Importing Pandas
	
		import pandas as pd

	###  2. Creating a DataFrame
	
		#### From a Dictionary
		
				data = {
			'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
			'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
			'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
			}

			df = pd.DataFrame(data)
			print(df)
		
	### 3. Data Manipulation

		#### Accessing Data
	
			# Display first few rows of the DataFrame
		
			print(df.head())

			# Accessing specific columns
		
			print(df['Name'])

			# Accessing specific rows and columns
		
			print(df.loc[0])  # Access first row
			print(df.loc[:, 'Age'])  # Access 'Age' column
			
		### Filtering Data	
			
			# Filtering data based on conditions
			
			print(df[df['Age'] > 30])

		
	### 4. Data Operations
	
		#### Handling Missing Data
		
			# Drop rows with missing values
			
			cleaned_data = df.dropna()

			# Fill missing values with a specific value
			
			filled_data = df.fillna(0)

		#### Merging and Joining Data
		
			# Create two DataFrames for merging
			
			data1 = pd.DataFrame({'Key': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'Value': [1, 2, 3]})
			data2 = pd.DataFrame({'Key': ['A', 'B', 'D'], 'Value': [4, 5, 6]})

			# Merge based on 'Key' column
			
			merged_data = pd.merge(data1, data2, on='Key')
			
		#### Grouping and Aggregating Data

			# Grouping data by 'City' and calculating the average age in each city
			
			grouped_data = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()
			print(grouped_data)
	
	### 5. Data input/Output
	
		#### Reading and Writing Data
			
			# Read data from a CSV file
			
			data_from_csv = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

			# Write data to a CSV file
			
			df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)

	### 6. Time Series Data
		
		#### Pandas offers various functionalities for handling time series data:
		
			# Resampling time series data
			
			time_series_data = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=10)
			print(time_series_data)

			# Shifting and lagging data
			
			shifted_data = df['Age'].shift(1)
			print(shifted_data)
