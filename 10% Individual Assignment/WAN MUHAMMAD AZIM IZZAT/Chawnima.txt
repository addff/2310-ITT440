##  EDITOR: Visual Studio

*What is Visual Studio?
Microsoft developed Visual Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE). 
It offers programmers a complete toolkit for creating software for desktop, mobile,
web, and cloud applications, among other platforms. Programming languages supported
by Visual Studio include C#, C++, F#, Visual Basic, Python, and more.

*Description of Visual Studio.
Visual Studio offers a powerful and all-inclusive software development environment.
It includes a vast range of information, services, and tools to help developers create apps.
This mean Visual Studio is Robust and Comprehensive.Additionally, Visual Studio supports a 
number of programming languages. Programming languages supported by it include Python, 
JavaScript, C#, C++, F#, Visual Basic, and more. Developers may choose their favourite 
language to work on a variety of projects thanks to its multi-language compatibility.


*Significant of Visual Studio.
You may finish the whole development cycle in one location using Visual Studio, 
a potent developer tool. You may write, edit, debug, and build code using this 
all-inclusive integrated development environment (IDE), and then launch your application.
Visual Studio provides a first-class Python editor, including syntax coloring, 
autocomplete across all your code and libraries, code formatting, signature help, 
refactoring, linting, and type hints.

##  LIBRARY: BeautifulSoup

*What is BeautifulSoup?
A library called Beautiful Soup makes it simple to extract data from websites.
It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse 
tree on top of an HTML or XML parser.

*Description of BeautifulSoup.
Appropriately named after tag soup, Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing
HTML and XML documents that contain malformed markup, or non-closed tags. 
For web scraping purposes, it generates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be 
utilised to extract data from HTML.

*Significant of BeautifulSoup.
The package's goal is clearly explained by its name, BeautifulSoup.
Using a tree of Python objects, it can be used to extract and separate user-required 
data from the mess that is HTML and XML files. It can extract data using a variety 
of methods, including NavigableString and tags.

##  FRAMEWORK: AIOHTTP

*What is AIOHTTP?
An HTTP client/server for asyncio is called aiohttp. In essence, it lets
you create asynchronous servers and clients. Client and Server WebSockets 
are also supported by the aiohttp package.

*Description of AIOHTTP.
Popular asynchronous framework AIOHTTP (http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/) 
is built on top of the asyncio library, which has existed since the library's 
inception. It offers a request object and a router to route queries to functions 
that can handle them, just like Flask.Full-duplex communication is made possible by 
the ability to create client and server WebSockets using aiohttp. This demonstrates 
how to build a WebSocket client that sends a message to the server and prints the response,
as well as a WebSocket server that relays messages back to the client.

*Significant of AIOHTTP.
AIOHTTP makes use of the asyncio library in Python to enable non-blocking I/O operations, 
improving responsiveness and performance. AIOHTTP is a flexible framework that can be used 
to build web applications and make HTTP requests. It functions as both a server and a client.
