#### Library : Pyglet 
Pyglet is a cross-platform Python multimedia and windowing framework that makes it easy to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs), animations, and games. Pyglet's goal is to provide developers with the tools and abstractions they need to create interactive, multimedia-rich programs.  Pyglet's goal is to provide developers with the tools and abstractions they need to create interactive, multimedia-rich programs. Thus, other platforms like mobile devices and embedded systems may also be used to developed apps. It includes tasks like as window management, visual display, picture loading, text display, audio playback, input handling, event handling and multithreading. Pyglet is easy to use and provides a consistent and straightforward API. It is also extensively documented and has a large user and contribution base. Pyglet is compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux.

Piglet requires no additional dependencies or installation. Pyglet requires only Python for most application and game requirements, simplifying distribution and installation. It's simple to package the project using freezers like PyInstaller. It may also make use of numerous windows and multi-monitor desktops. It supports many windows and is fully aware of multi-monitor setups for usage with fullscreen games and apps. It can also load images, sounds, music, and video in practically any format. Pyglet has support for common audio and picture formats and can load practically any additional compressed audio and video files via ffmpeg.

#### Framework : Pyramid 
Pyramid is a Python web framework that is simple and flexible to create a web-based application. It was developed for creating expansive web-based applications. It supports many databases and templating engines and is designed on top of the WSGI interface. Due to its basic design, developers can add certain elements as needed. Its compatibility for several databases, authentication techniques and template engines make it adaptable to many different types of web development tasks.

Pyramid offers a variety of tools and libraries for routing, views, templates, and other features that make developing online applications easier. No matter what scale the project is, it allows developers to choose the libraries and tools that suit them best. Developers can configure the project structure manually or use the command-line tool to build a Pyramid project. The application defines its routes, views and templates. It can add more functionality by using third-party packages and other database libraries.

#### Editor : NetBeans  
NetBeans is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) software development platform that supports many programming languages such as Java, Python, C/C++ and many others. It is a primary tool which can be use forwriting, editing, and organizing code in many programming languages. It has functions like code completion, which may automatically finish the code according on the context, and intelligent suggestions, which identify grammatical issues in the code. It also offers refactoring and debugging tools including step-by-step debugging, breakpoints, and watchpoints that can assist to locate and correct the code to expedite the debugging process and decrease the time spent troubleshooting.

NetBeans allows developers to write extensions to the IDE that provide support for additional languages or additional features like Docker integration. Furthermore, NetBeans offers lots of plugins and extensions that may be used to enhance its features, such as allowing developers to customise their work environment by adding additional functionality or language support.
