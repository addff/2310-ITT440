#Template/ framework in python#

Dask is a parallel computing framework in Python that allows you to efficiently process and analyze large datasets. 
It's designed to scale from a single machine to a cluster of machines and provides a familiar interface to users of 
Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Dask is particularly useful for tasks that involve big data, 
distributed computing, and parallel processing. Here are some key features and concepts related to Dask:

Some of the significant of Dask included:

	1.	Parallel and Distributed Computing: Dask enables parallel and distributed computing for computationally 
        intensive tasks. It can utilize multiple CPU cores on a single machine or scale out to a cluster of machines 
		to process large datasets.
		
	2.	Familiar API: Dask provides APIs that are similar to popular Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. 
	    This makes it easy for users of these libraries to transition to Dask for working with larger-than-memory datasets.
		
	3.	Dask Arrays: Dask arrays are a parallel and distributed alternative to NumPy arrays. They break large arrays 
	    into smaller chunks and allow for parallel computation on those chunks. Dask arrays are useful for operations 
		on large numerical datasets.
		
	4.	Dask DataFrames: Dask DataFrames are similar to Pandas DataFrames but can handle larger-than-memory data. They 
	    enable parallel and distributed processing of tabular data.
		
	5.	Dask Bags: Dask Bags are collections of generic Python objects. They are suitable for processing unstructured or 
	    semi-structured data, such as log files or JSON data.
		
	6.	Task Scheduling: Dask uses a dynamic task scheduler to manage the execution of tasks. It creates a directed acyclic 
	    graph (DAG) of tasks, allowing for efficient parallel execution.
		
	7.	Lazy Evaluation: Dask employs a lazy evaluation strategy, meaning that it defers computation until it's necessary. 
	    This can optimize the use of memory and CPU resources.
		
	8.	Interoperability: Dask is designed to work seamlessly with other Python libraries and tools. It can be integrated 
	    with popular machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.


In summary, Dask is particularly valuable for data scientists and analysts working with large datasets or conducting 
computationally intensive tasks. By leveraging its parallel and distributed computing capabilities, you can efficiently 
process and analyze data that would be challenging to handle using traditional single-machine approaches.






#Editor/ IDE for python#

A data science IDE for Python. RODEO, that is an open-source python IDE and has been brought up by the folks at that,
is a development environment that is lightweight, intuitive and yet customizable to its very core and contains all 
the features mentioned above that were searched for so long. It is just like your very own personal home base for 
exploration and interpretation of data that aims at Data Scientists and answers the main question, "Is there anything 
like RStudio for Python?" Rodeo makes it very easy for its users to explore what is created by them and also alongside 
allows the users to Inspect, interact, compare data frames, plots and even much more. It is an IDE that has been built 
especially for data science/Machine Learning in Python and you can also very simply think of it as a lightweight
