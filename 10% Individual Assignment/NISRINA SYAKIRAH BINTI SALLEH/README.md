1.	Do find 1 libraries/modules in Python created for Network Engineer.
-	# Genie

2.	Do find 1 template/framework in Python.
-	# Jinja2

3.	Do find 3 editor/IDE for Python.
-	# Google Colaboratory

1.	Write the significance of all tools found.

-	# Genie
Genie is a Python library designed and customized for automated web testing. It's easy to use and instantly gives engineers incredible insight into the health of their network. Essentially, using Genie CLI, engineers are able to collect and compare different snapshots of the state of the network, and perform automated comparisons to determine exactly what has changed.

-	# Jinja2
A well-liked Python templating engine and framework for creating dynamic content, including HTML, XML, and other markup languages, is called Jinja2. Although it can be used alone for different templating purposes, it is extensively utilized in web development frameworks such as Flask and Django.

-	# Google Colaboratory
Google Colaboratory, or Google Colab, is a web-based development environment allowing users to run and write code in Python. It is free of cost environment provided by Google that enables users to execute code, save and share notebooks, and collaborate with others in real time. It can also be directly put into GitHub. In this lesson, we'll look closely at Google Colab and explore some of its features.

5.	Reason to use all tools found. 

# Genie
-	Because Genie libraries/modules in Python simplify complex tasks, support multiple vendors, enhance code readability, have built-in testing and verification, are scalable, offer telemetry capabilities, integration options, and have a helpful documentation and community, network engineers can use them for their network automation needs. Genie can improve network dependability and efficiency by streamlining network administration and lowering mistake rates.

# Jinja2
-	Network engineers now have a strong and adaptable tool in Jinja2 to help them manage network configurations, automate network chores, maintain consistency, and improve the general effectiveness and dependability of network management procedures. It is especially helpful in intricate and dynamic network systems where control maintenance and lowering the possibility of human error are crucial.

# Google Colaboratory
-	Google Colab, sometimes known as Google Colaboratory, is an online Python development environment that offers a cloud-based interface akin to a Jupyter notebook. Although Google Colab is mostly utilized for data science and machine learning jobs, network engineers might also benefit from using it for some elements of their work. For network engineers looking to take advantage of Python's ecosystem and power for network automation, analysis, and data visualization in a user-friendly and cooperative cloud setting, it can be a great environment.

6.	Demonstrate how to use all tools found.
