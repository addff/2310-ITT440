## LIBRARY : MATPLOTLIB

### What is Matplotlib?
    Matplotlib is a widely used Python library for data visualization and plotting. A variety of plots, charts, histograms, and other visual data representations can be made with it by users.
    Created by John D. Hunter, Matplotlib is a foundational tool for Python data analysis and scientific computing, offering an extensive range of features for producing publications-quality, high-quality visualisations.
    With so many options for altering and improving visualisations, the library is incredibly customisable.         
    To create static, animated, or interactive plots, Matplotlib can be integrated into standalone Python scripts.       
    Matplotlib is an effective tool for data analysis and visualisation in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, as well as for general data exploration. It integrates,well with NumPy, Pandas, and other libraries.
