### Framework/Template

1. What is Twisted
Twisted is an open-source, event-driven networking engine written in Python. 

2. Description
Provides a framework for building networked applications, offering a wide range of functionalities 
for asynchronous I/O, network protocol handling, and event-driven programming.


3. Significance
i.		Simplifies the development of networked applications by handling communication
		between clients and servers in an asynchronous and non-blocking way. 
ii.		Support for various network protocols (like TCP, UDP, SSL)


4. Demonstrate



### Libraries/Modules


1. What is Netmiko
Netmiko is an open-source that was created to make network devices configuration and management more automated. 

2. Description
Network automation has been completely transformed by the Netmiko library,
It's a great tool for network engineers and administrators since it abstracts the complexity of 
interfacing with various device models and manufacturers.

3. Significance
i.		Consistency in network configurations and modifications is guaranteed,
ii.		Network engineers can be sure configurations are implemented consistently to every device,
iv.		Support for various vendors' network devices, including Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Huawei, and others
v.		Providing a simple and consistent way to connect and communicate with devices using Python.
vi.		Providing resources and support for users to learn and implement network automation effectively.


4. Demonstrate


### Editor/EDI


1. What is Jupyter
Jupyter is an open-source web application.

2. Description
Web-based interactive computing platform that allows userscreate and 
share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and 
narrative text.

3. Significance
i. 		Jupyter provides an interactive platform where users can write, execute, and 
		modify code in a step-by-step manner.
ii.		Jupyter supports various programming languages through its kernel system.
		Some of the languages supported by Jupyter is Python, R code, Julia, JavaScript, 
		Scala code,  C++, Ruby, Haskell, Go, and more.
iii.	Creation of documents combining live code, visualizations, and explanatory text,
		making it easier to explore data, create graphs, and explain findings all in one place.
iv		A useful educational tool for teaching coding, data science and other computational 
		concepts due to its interactive and explanatory nature.
