## FRAMEWORK

## Eve:

### What is Eve?

Eve is a versatile and lightweight framework that works particularly well with MongoDB to let developers quickly 
and effectively create RESTful APIs. A large portion of the complexity associated with developing an API is 
abstracted away, freeing developers to concentrate on defining resources and business logic as opposed to figuring 
out minute details.

### Description of Eve.

Eve is a flexible framework that makes building RESTful APIs easy for developers. Its ease of use, ability to 
automatically generate CRUD operations, interaction with MongoDB, and expandability make it a desirable option 
for projects requiring a simple and quick construction of an API.

### Significant of Eve.

Expression and Simplicity: Eve's design prioritises simplicity. The framework's expressive and intuitive syntax for 
resource definition makes it simple for developers to comprehend and utilise.

Automated CRUD Procedures: Eve's ability to automatically produce CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
based on the given schema is one of its most notable characteristics. As a result, a lot less boilerplate code 
is required for fundamental API functionality.

RESTful Principles: Eve emphasises the usage of common HTTP methods and status codes in accordance with RESTful 
design principles. RESTful principles are followed, which encourages uniformity and user-friendliness for both 
API developers and users.

## LIBRARY

## Scikit-learn:

### What is Scikit-learn?

A popular and adaptable open-source machine learning library for Python is called Scikit-learn. It offers a range 
of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other tasks. 
It also offers straightforward and effective tools for data analysis and modelling. Due to its foundation in NumPy, SciPy, 
and Matplotlib, Scikit-learn is a fundamental component of the Python data science ecosystem.

### Description of Scikit-learn.

For data scientists and machine learning professionals, Scikit-learn is a dependable partner, providing a comprehensive 
range of tools for effortless data exploration, modelling, and analysis. Whether you're developing a sophisticated 
ensemble or designing your first model, Scikit-learn can help to streamline your process.

### Significant of Scikit-learn.

Usability: Scikit-learn was created with ease of use in mind. Both novices and experts can use it because of its consistent 
API and easy-to-understand documentation. Its extensive popularity has been facilitated by its ease of usage.

Wide-ranging Algorithm Support: The library offers implementations for a wide range of machine learning applications, 
including dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, and classification. It is a useful tool for a variety of 
applications because of its adaptability.

Consistent Interface: The ability to experiment and transition between models is made easier by the uniform interface between 
various methods. Maintaining this uniformity lowers the learning curve and increases productivity when experimenting with 
various machine learning algorithms.

## EDITOR

## Sublime Text:

### What is Sublime Text?

Developers utilise Sublime Text, a powerful text editor, for both coding and text editing jobs. It is renowned for its 
broad feature set, speed, and adaptability. Jon Skinner created Sublime Text, which is well-known for its ease of use 
and potent features.

### Description of Sublime Text.

Text enthusiasts and developers will find Sublime Text to be a strong yet minimalistic text editor. Coders who value 
efficiency and a seamless editing experience love it for its speed, adaptability, and customization choices.

### Significant of Sublime Text.

Speed and Efficiency: Sublime Text excels in speed and efficiency, which is one of its most notable qualities. Developers may 
navigate and change code with little lag because to its lightweight design and fast opening speed.

Multiple Selections: Having the capacity to choose from several options at once changes everything. Developers can save time 
and effort by utilising it to make intricate changes to several lines of code at once.

Personalization: With Sublime Text's extensive customization options, users may make the editor exactly how they want it. 
This improves the whole coding experience and includes colour schemes, themes, and the ability to make custom key bindings.
