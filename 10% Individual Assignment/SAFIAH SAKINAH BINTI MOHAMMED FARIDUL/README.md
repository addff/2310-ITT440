What is Atom?

Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux, and Windows with
support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub [1]. Atom is
a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software
licenses and are community-built and maintained. It is written in Coffee Script and Less. It can also be
used as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Atom is based on Electron, a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using
Chromium and Node.js. This in a way allows Atom to be very flexible and “hackable” as the
developers call it. Atom is a testament to the power of the Electron API and is a fast, customizable
alternative to many other popular code editors. Users can easily extend it by developing rich packages
or by editing configuration files that are open for modification
