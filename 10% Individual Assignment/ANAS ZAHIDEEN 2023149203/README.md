### FRAMEWORK

#### Quart
##### What is Quart?

Quart is a web framework for Python that is designed for asynchronous programming, making it suitable for building web applications that can handle a high level of concurrency and parallelism. Quart is inspired by the Flask web framework and is built on top of the popular ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) specification. It provides an asynchronous alternative to Flask, which is traditionally a synchronous WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) framework.

##### Quart Features:

Here are some key features and characteristics of the Quart framework:

1) Asynchronous Support: Quart allows developers to write asynchronous code using Python's async/await syntax, which can improve the performance of web applications by handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

2) Flask-Like Syntax: If you're familiar with Flask, Quart's syntax and structure will feel quite similar, making it relatively easy for Flask developers to transition to asynchronous programming.

3) ASGI Compatibility: Quart is built on top of ASGI, which is a specification for asynchronous web servers and applications. This means it can work with ASGI-compliant servers like Uvicorn or Hypercorn.

4) WebSocket Support: Quart includes built-in support for WebSocket connections, allowing you to build real-time, interactive applications.

5) Session Handling: It provides session management for user authentication and data storage, similar to what Flask offers.

### LIBRARY
#### Peewee

##### What is Peewee?

Peewee is a small, lightweight, and expressive Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for interacting with databases, making it easier for developers to work with relational databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others, in a more abstract and intuitive way. Peewee is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use.

##### Peewee features:

Some key features and characteristics of the Peewee library include:

1) SQL Expression Builder: Peewee allows you to build SQL queries using Python code and expressions. It provides a high-level, object-oriented interface for creating and executing SQL statements.

2) Database Abstraction: Peewee abstracts the differences between various database backends, allowing you to write database code that is independent of the specific database system you're using.

3) Model Classes: Peewee introduces the concept of model classes, which represent database tables. You can define models in your Python code, and Peewee automatically generates the corresponding database tables and manages the relationships between them.

4) Data Validation: Peewee includes built-in data validation and type coercion, helping to ensure data integrity when interacting with the database.

5) Query Building: It provides a rich set of tools for building complex database queries, including filtering, sorting, aggregations, and more.

6) Migrations: Peewee supports database schema migrations, allowing you to evolve your database schema over time as your application's requirements change.

7) Transactions: You can work with database transactions using Peewee to ensure data consistency and integrity in multi-step operations.

8) Plugin System: Peewee has a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality with additional features and integrations.
